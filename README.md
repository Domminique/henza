In the digital age, there seems to be a smartphone app for everything — from ordering coffee to logging your water consumption. Fortunately, tech developers have also designed practical tools for individuals navigating a cancer diagnosis.

Though these apps by no means replace the professional guidance of a cancer care team, they do connect people with resources and make the journey to recovery slightly less scary.

With this in mind, the radiation oncologists at SERO have curated a list of the seven best free apps for cancer patients and caregivers.

Best Apps for Staying Organized
In the wake of a cancer diagnosis, patients and caregivers are bombarded with medical visits, medication lists, and treatment protocols. Though you could try to stay organized the old-fashioned way with pen and paper, these three apps will make your life much easier.

Cancer.Net Mobile
Keeping up with chemotherapy appointments and new symptoms can be overwhelming. Thankfully, Cancer.Net Mobile, a mobile application from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, can help with that.

Available on both iOS and Android devices, Cancer.Net Mobile offers trusted, oncologist-approved information on 125 types of cancer. The app also features practical tools, including:

A symptom tracker that automatically plots the severity, date, and time of your symptoms on an easy-to-read graph
A question recorder that helps you take notes during medical appointments
A medication log that allows you to take photos of your medication bottles and note dosages
CareZone
Forgetting to take your cancer medication — or, worse yet, taking it twice by accident — can have dangerous consequences. To keep yourself safe, download CareZone.

CareZone, an application available on iOS and Android, helps you organize your health information in a cinch. More specifically, the app allows users to:

Scan medication bottles to create a detailed list of medications
Stay on track with reminders to take a medication or log blood sugar/blood pressure
Automate pharmacy refills
Reminders
When patients begin chemotherapy, many experience mental cloudiness. They may struggle to complete certain tasks, concentrate at work, or remember important dates. This phenomenon is known as “chemo brain.”

Reminders, an app for Apple devices, is the perfect companion for a cancer patient who is suffering from chemo brain. With this application, you can use Siri to create Smart Lists — lists that gather your to-dos based on tags, dates, times, locations, and flags.

Reminders is also helpful for caregivers, especially those juggling a full-time job. Using the collaborate feature, you can easily lighten your load by assigning certain tasks to friends and family. If, for example, you have a work meeting the same day as your father’s radiotherapy treatment, you can assign transportation to your sibling.

Best Apps for Finding Support
No one should have to endure cancer alone. With this in mind, tech creatives have developed a host of tools that allow cancer patients and caregivers to connect with friends, family, and even strangers. These two apps are sure to help you feel less alone.  

BELONG — Beating Cancer Together
Fighting cancer without a support system can be exhausting. That’s why the founders of BELONG — Beating Cancer Together rolled out their free and anonymous software.

This application is the world’s largest social and professional network for cancer patients. Users on both iOS and Android devices can chat directly with world-renowned oncologists and clinical researchers. You can also join support groups for patients and caregivers based on cancer type.

LivingWith: Cancer Support
Available for Apple devices, LivingWith: Cancer Support helps individuals connect with their community. Using the app, you can search for advocacy events based on location and cancer type.

You can also build a private circle of support. After inviting your friends and family to join the app, you can share important medical appointments and test results. Plus, you can request assistance with tasks like grocery shopping or cooking.

Though designed for patients, LivingWith: Cancer Support can be used by caregivers as well. Rather than text all of your siblings individually, you can send a single update regarding your mother’s health on the app.

Best Apps for Self-Care
Many oncology patients experience anxiety and depression as they undergo treatment. Caregivers often struggle with their mental health as well. Fortunately, there are apps that can help you find peace.

Create To Heal
The Create to Heal app is a tool for cancer patients, survivors, and their families. The goal of the app, which is available for Apple devices, is to “gently take you from your head to your heart, where the healing process begins.” More specifically, Create to Heal features:

10 music tracks
Four guided meditations
36 pieces of art
More than 60 inspirational messages
Though this app is no replacement for speaking with a mental health professional, it has been tested in several hospitals and cancer centers over a five-year period.

MindShift
Developed by Anxiety Canada, an anxiety awareness nonprofit organization, MindShift teaches users to reframe their anxious thoughts and make lasting behavioral changes. Tools like breathing exercises, thought journals, and guided medications incorporate cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. The app offers peer-to-peer community forums as well.

MindShift is perfect for combating insomnia, which is fairly common among cancer patients. It’s also a great remedy for pre-treatment anxiety. Rather than spend 15 minutes in the waiting room worrying about your radiotherapy appointment, you can put in headphones and complete a quick meditation. Or, you can journal about your thoughts and feelings.

GoodRx
Another popular app is GoodRx, which helps you find the best prices and coupons on leading medications. The app is free to use. Simply show the GoodRx coupon (which you can access via the app) to a pharmacist when you drop of your prescription to be filled.

Seek Support from Your SERO Cancer Care Team
At SERO, we understand that the journey to recovery is not easy. That’s why our 30-plus board-certified radiation oncologists are here to help you navigate cancer treatment.

We are available when you have a question about the side effects of radiotherapy, what to eat to stay healthy, and everything in between. We also know that cancer doesn’t just affect the patient. With this in mind, we have compiled resources for caregivers as well. 

To learn more about how SERO can support you and your family, call us at 704-680-6570.

NFCR
Cancer: There’s An App for That (2020 Update)
DECEMBER 10, 2020  NFCR WRITER BRITTANY CIUPKA  BLOG
Cancer Apps for Patients and Survivors
To keep the NFCR community up to date with the best tools of technology, the team has compiled a list of the best apps for cancer patients in 2020.

In 2017, National Foundation for Cancer Research reviewed some of the best cancer apps available for patients and their families. From tracking appointments to monitoring health and finding expert advice, these phone apps proved to be a cancer patient’s best friend. Though three years doesn’t seem all that long, technology can change so much in a short period of time.

The year has been demanding and challenging in many ways, leaving many people across the world in isolation like never before. Prior to this year, apps were an additional resource used for convenience. The pandemic-related isolation has changed apps and remote tools into a necessity, sparking innovation and invention.

BELONG – Beating Cancer Together
Though Belong.Life is a new addition to the list, it is already being used by 250,000 people affected by cancer. Designed to mimic a social media platform, Belong helps people find support groups for all types of cancers and gives users access to leading researchers who can answer any questions a cancer patient or their family members may have. This free app also helps people find clinical trials and allows users to input medical records.

Cancer.Net Mobile
Cancer.Net Mobile continues to be one of the best apps available. This free app is offered by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and is instrumental in helping patients plan and manage care. The app keeps track of symptoms, appointments, medications, questions, and health care providers while providing information on over 120 types of cancer. Cancer.Net is also available in languages other than English.

CareZone
CareZone is the most popular cancer-related app in 2020. This organizational app helps patients remember treatments, plan care notes, summarize drug administration protocols, deliver medication and doctors’ visit reminders, and simplify treatment through taking and retaining pictures of medications, prescriptions, and supplements. The app also provides a journaling area for tracking appointments and keeping notes to discuss with doctors. In addition to monitoring cancer-related care, CareZone lets you track essential health stats like sleep, blood glucose, weight, and more.

However, the best thing about CareZone is the fact that all of the information in the app can also be accessed on a browser and downloaded when needed.

CaringBridge
CaringBridge is another free app created in association with the CaringBridge, a social networking site for people living with chronic medical conditions. CaringBridge allows you to post health updates and any other information you would like to share with family and friends. It is perfect for those times when you get a test result and don’t feel up to calling all of your loved ones to share the news.

My Medical
There are so many free apps available that it often isn’t worth paying for one. That being said, My Medical can be an extremely useful tool in some situations. The app stores all medical information from allergies and medications to previous surgeries and specialist contact details. It can also warehouse more than one person’s information, making it ideal for couples and families. My Medical contains a section to record lab results, a useful feature often missing from other medical apps.

Moodfit
Mental health is extremely important in caring for one’s overall wellbeing. Moodfit is a free mental health app designed to help users ‘shape up’ their mood. After seeing many apps focus on helping people get into physical shape, the designers of Moodfit crafted this app to help people get into mental shape. The app provides a questionnaire to determine the severity of symptoms, as well as many articles and audio files designed to help people understand what they’re experiencing. Users can track their mood over time and gain insight into which type of things affect their feelings. There’s also a cognitive behavioral therapy portion of the app which can teach people how to dispute overly negative thoughts.

No matter what your diagnosis, level of understanding or internet savviness, there’s an app that can help you. It’s important to remember that these tools are not meant in any way to replace a doctor or specialist, but they can bring relief, organization and help connect to resources and people who wish to provide support to cancer patients. See your online app store and consult with your doctor or oncology social worker for further or more specific guidance on those apps which might best benefit you.
